# Autodesk Memcached Client

This is a fork of the [Enyim.Memcached](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached) .NET client library for [memcached](http://memcached.org) written in C#. There is also a client for [Membase](http://membase.com)'s persistent memcached server.

## Requirements

This is currently only targetting DNX Core 5.0

## Tests
You need to run the `memcached.exe` in the `misc\LocalWindowsMemcached` to make any of the unit tests works
